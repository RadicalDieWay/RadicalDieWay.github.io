                During my first year at university, I developed a tile puzzle game as part of a module where we used C# and MonoGame. Having prior experience with C# in Unity, MonoGame provided a unique learning opportunity, challenging me to adapt and expand my skills.

                One key feature I wanted to implement was the ability to generate a dynamic grid that could accommodate any puzzle size, ranging from 3x3 to 10x10. To achieve this, I created a system that slices any image into tiles of uniform width and height, ensuring the puzzle always fits the same screen space regardless of grid size. This allowed players to seamlessly interact with the game while maintaining a consistent visual experience. Additionally, I integrated leaderboards for each puzzle, using file reading to store and load scores. Players can enter their name when they make it to the leaderboard, allowing them to compare scores with others.

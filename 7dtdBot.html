                “7 Days to Die” is a survival horror sandbox game by Fun Pimps. 
                The game is still in Beta and suffers a duplication glitch which 
                the allowed could allow for faster levelling up, so I wanted to 
                have a go at automating the process using Python.

                Using the win32api library and PlayStation remote play I was able 
                to feed inputs to my console. I had some foundations of this already
                 from a previous project 
                 (<a href="theatrhythmBot.html" style="display: inline;">Click here to read more!</a>)
                 so I built and
                 modified upon that. Making the system follow a pre-programmed set
                 of inputs where it would perform the entire glitch autonomously.
                 This was a great side-project however, no one should use the code
                 for this use case, the game is much fun, and I at least would 
                 rather level up as intended.

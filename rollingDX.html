                "Rolling" is a 3D platformer developed in Unity as part of a first-year university module. I was heavily inspired by “Super Monkey Ball”, which presented the fun challenge of controlling a player represented simply as a ball, while also visualizing the rotation of the level in a similar way. After the module concluded, I continued to expand the game by adding new levels and implementing a level select screen in the main menu, allowing players to choose any level they'd like.

                Throughout the project, I gained more experience with Unity’s physics system, as the player’s movement was driven by applied forces. I also became more proficient in creating scalable UI elements, ensuring that all interface components adjusted to different screen sizes while providing players with easy navigation through multiple menu tabs.

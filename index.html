            <p>"Scrap Forge" is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure game set on a forgotten planet, 
                collapsed, unloved, and filled with junk littered everywhere. Fighting other robots, 
                you must try to find out what happened to the planet and fix your ship to escape it. 
                On this project, I was a lead developer keeping development on track while still 
                developing features myself and maintaining the GitHub.</p>

            <p> Cubic Hoards is a Nintendo Switch sandbox survival game taking placed in a procedurally generated voxel world. This game was made for a university module where we had to make a game on a platform of our choice, I chose the Nintendo Switch as I hoped it would provide a unique challenge.

                This game uses a 3D array to store and manage all the blocks with block dynamically enabling when visible and vice versa. Using this array, I was able to create A star pathfinding for the enemy zombies where only search within a set range of their position within this array to keep performance consistent on larger worlds. On top of this, the pathfinding updates with the players breaking and places of blocks within the world the ensure their movement is accurate to the world the player creates.

                This game uses seeds to determine the landscape of each world, in a size of the players choice. I wanted to create a game where a player could pick up and put down the game whenever they choose so I implemented the ability to save and load worlds to their console.            </p>

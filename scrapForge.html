            <p> "Scrap Forge" is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure game set on a forgotten planet, collapsed, unloved, 
                and filled with junk littered everywhere. Playing as a robot called "Scrappy" you have crash-landed 
                on a lonely world. Scrappy now must explore and learn about the planet's past to find parts to repair 
                their ship. However, it won't be as easy as other robots will try to stop you each step of the way.  
                This game was made at the end of my first year at BCU and had the whole Development class working alongside 
                students studying both Video Game Design and Art.

                On this project, I was a lead developer overseeing the other developers on my course (around 15 people) 
                to keep development on track while still developing features myself and managing the GitHub project so that 
                people could always be up to date with others to keep development as smooth as possible. Being lead developer 
                meant I was also in constant contact with designers and producers to ensure that the game matched the vision 
                of designers as well as helping artists get their assets into unity and help them navigate the engine and game 
                as efficiently as possible as this was many of their first time using it.

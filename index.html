            <p>"Paper Sword" is a top-down action RPG made in Unity. Inspired by Zelda, Dark Souls, and Death's Door, 
                It features hit-and-roll-based combat with a shield to block projectiles. 
                I made this game in summer between by foundation and first year of university.</p>

            <p>This project taught me how to use Unity's input system for supporting controller as well as keyboard. 
                I also added a basic leveling system in the game to increase, strength, stamina and health. 
                The game also featured a save and load feature so they coulld start and stop wherever they choose.</p>
